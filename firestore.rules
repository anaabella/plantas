/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Plant Tracker application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access
 * their own profile data and the plants and associated data they own. All data
 * is nested under /users/{userId} to simplify authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/plants/{plantId}: Stores plant information for a given user.
 * - /users/{userId}/wishlist/{wishlistItemId}: Stores wishlist items for a given user.
 * - /users/{userId}/plants/{plantId}/rootData/{rootDataId}: Stores root data for a given plant.
 * - /users/{userId}/plants/{plantId}/leafData/{leafDataId}: Stores leaf data for a given plant.
 * - /users/{userId}/plants/{plantId}/clippingData/{clippingDataId}: Stores clipping data for a given plant.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - No public listing of users is allowed.
 * - Path-based ownership is enforced for all data.
